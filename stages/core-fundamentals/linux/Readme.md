#### Setup Docker Bash Container
 If you are running on Windows and you don'y have access to a Linux terminal, you should install Docker and setup your Bash container. 
We will use the same container setup in our Video tutorial.

 After you have installed Docker open your Windows `cmd`or `PowerShell` command prompt and run the following
```
docker run -it --rm bash:4.4
```
_this will open and interactive shell and here is where we will run our Bash learning._
